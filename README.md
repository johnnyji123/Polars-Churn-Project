# Polars-Churn-Project
### Questions tackled:
* Which age groups send more SMS messages than make phone calls?
* Create a plot visualizing the number of distinct phone calls by age group. Within the chart, differentiate between short, medium, and long calls (by the number of seconds).
*Are there significant differences between the length of phone calls between different tariff plans?
* You have access to a dataset of the company's customers, including whether customers churned. The telecom company wants to know whether you can use this data to predict whether a customer will churn. They also want to know what factors increase the probability that a customer churns.
